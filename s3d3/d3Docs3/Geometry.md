**The [D3 4.0 API Reference](https://github.com/d3/d3/blob/master/API.md) has moved. This page describes the D3 3.x API.**

See one of:

* [Voronoi](Voronoi-Geom.md) - compute the Voronoi tesselation or Delaunay triangulation from a set of points.
* [Quadtree](Quadtree-Geom.md) - compute a quadtree from a set of points.
* [Hull](Hull-Geom.md) - compute the convex hull of a set of points.
* [Polygon](Polygon-Geom.md) - perform polygon operations, such as computing area and clipping.

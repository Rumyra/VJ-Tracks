> [API Reference](API-Reference.md) â–¸ **Layouts**

**The [D3 4.0 API Reference](https://github.com/d3/d3/blob/master/API.md) has moved. This page describes the D3 3.x API.**

A layout encapsulates a strategy for laying out data elements visually, relative to each other. It could be as simple as stacking bars in a chart (where the base of one bar depends on the height of any below it) or as complex as labeling a map (by shifting labels around until overlap with conflicting map features is minimized). Layouts take a set of input data, apply an algorithm or heuristic, and output the resulting positions/shapes for a cohesive display of the data.

Layouts are not unlike [d3.svg path generators](SVG-Shapes.md#path-data-generators), in that they facilitate the conversion of data to display form. However, layouts typically operate across a collection of data as a whole, rather than individually. Furthermore, the results of a layout could be used anywhere, not just with SVG. Some layouts are even dynamic through time: for example, you `.start()` a `d3.layout.force()` instance and then listen for layout updates on `'tick'` events.

Many layouts are built in to D3 itself:

* [Bundle](Bundle-Layout.md) - apply Holten's *hierarchical bundling algorithm* to edges.
* [Chord](Chord-Layout.md) - produce a chord diagram from a matrix of relationships.
* [Cluster](Cluster-Layout.md) - cluster entities into a dendrogram.
* [Force](Force-Layout.md) - position linked nodes using physical simulation.
* [Hierarchy](Hierarchy-Layout.md) - derive a custom hierarchical layout implementation.
* [Histogram](Histogram-Layout.md) - compute the distribution of data using quantized bins.
* [Pack](Pack-Layout.md) - produce a hierarchical layout using recursive circle-packing.
* [Partition](Partition-Layout.md) - recursively partition a node tree into a sunburst or icicle.
* [Pie](Pie-Layout.md) - compute the start and end angles for arcs in a pie or donut chart.
* [Stack](Stack-Layout.md) - compute the baseline for each series in a stacked bar or area chart.
* [Tree](Tree-Layout.md) - position a tree of nodes tidily.
* [Treemap](Treemap-Layout.md) - use recursive spatial subdivision to display a tree of nodes.

Layouts instances are sometimes functions (though not necessarily) that can be configured and then applied to a set of data. Other times, specific methods or event handlers are used for data input and position output. Please refer to the documentation of each particular layout for usage.
